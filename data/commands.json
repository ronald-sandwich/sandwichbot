Be nice, we're here to have fun. Rough banter is ok, but don't let things get heated. If a user complains about your behaviour, you may be given a warning. Repeat offences may result in a ban. \n2. Don't spam. Repeatedly sending the same message or unnecessarily breaking up a message into smaller parts is aggravating. Any copy pasta or spam may be deleted, especially if it does not contribute to a conversation. If you want to post a large amount of text, use pastebin or take a screenshot.\n3. Do not impersonate other users. This is grounds for a ban. Attempting to circumnavigate bans will result in a longer ban.\n4. Don't draw out arguments if you don't have any evidence to support your position. Intentionally 'baiting' to start an argument may be grounds for a kick or ban.\n5. Intentionally spoiling another user may be grounds for a ban. If there is a designated spoiler chat, be sure to discuss that topic only in that chat.\n6. Brigading other chats (or any internet community) is a bannable offence.\n7. Skirting the boundaries of rule breaking or mod instructions just to aggravate people may get you banned\nChat hierarchy:\nOwners/Sr.mods are in charge of the server. They have do just about anything to just about anyone, including kicking, banning, permission assigning and creating or deleting channels. Their main job is to enforce rules and keep the chat peaceful as best they can. If one of these guys tells you to do something, you should probably do it.\nMods are the next level down. They can kick, ban, delete messages, move people from voice chats, tag people and send you to the gulag. As with admins, if they tell you to do something you should listen.\nYou may notice a few other people running around with colourful names.
